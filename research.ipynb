Well, **the optimal time is Friday or Saturday**, because the Hacker News community is the most active during this period of the week. However, time frames between **3.00pm and 9.00pm** during every day is proved as effective for posting a question to the public. Having that in mind, consider posting **Friday from 3.00pm till 9.00pm**, so that your post would get attention from a larger group of entusiasts, thus having more chance for an open discussion on your topic.\n",
