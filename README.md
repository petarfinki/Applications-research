# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

## Project Introduction
There are approximately 2 million iOS apps available on the App Store, and 2.1 million Android apps on Google Play. The two app stores are great players in the app industry and have developed excellent customer bases. Launched in 2008, they have significantly grown ever since. In the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store, users can browse and download Android and iOS apps as well as music, books, movies, and television programmes. 

This is effectively a duopoly between two technology giants: Apple Inc., which controls both iOS software and smartphone hardware; and Google’s, which runs on devices produced by different companies yet still manages to thrive across various locations around the world despite not being affiliated with any specific manufacturer itself. These differences have caused each company to succeed at slightly differing use cases depending upon their region/country of choice, but they remain persistent competitors nonetheless.

## Project Flow
1. Opening and Exploring the Data
2. Most common apps by Genre
3. Most Popular Apps by Genre on the App Store
4. Most Popular Apps by Genre on Google Play
5. Conclusion

## Future work
There are many positive things about the two app stores, but, of course, there are also some downsides that give them plenty of room for improvement. For future work, we can conclude visualizations based on the analysis done and furthermore expand the research.
